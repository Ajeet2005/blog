            <h2>Setting Out</h2>
            <p>
                Embarking on a journey often begins with a spark of spontaneity, a fleeting idea that quickly takes shape. For me and my companion, Pasang, this spark ignited our plan for a 1-night, 2-day adventure to Mardi, a serene trekking destination nestled in the heart of the Annapurna region.            </p>
            
                <p>Pasang, my trusted companion for this journey, brought an added layer of excitement to the trek. A dedicated veterinarian hailing from Mahashila Parbat, he is a man whose compassion extends far beyond his patients. This trek, his first-ever foray into the realm of trekking, was more than just a journey—it was a step into the unknown. His enthusiasm, despite being a novice, mirrored the spirit of exploration that defined our adventure. </p>
                <h2>Rendezvous in Pokhara</h2>
                <p>
                    
                    Pasang arrived in Pokhara on the 6th of November, bringing with him a palpable sense of anticipation. The evening was spent in a flurry of preparation. After a warm greeting, we turned our attention to one of the most crucial elements of the trip—our mode of transport.
                    Our trusted Royal Enfield motorcycle, a symbol of resilience and reliability, underwent a thorough inspection. Every bolt was tightened, the oil checked, and the engine fine-tuned, ensuring it was ready to tackle the winding roads leading to Deurali, our first stop.</p>

            <h2>Gearing Up for the Journey</h2>
            <p>
                With the bike in prime condition, we turned our focus to gathering supplies essential for the trek. A quick trip to the local store(Urban Mart) equipped us with a variety of snacks that would fuel our journey:<br>
                Coffee: For a comforting start to crisp mornings.<br>
            Chocolates: Energy-packed treats to keep us moving.<br>
                Noodles and Biscuits: Easy-to-prepare sustenance for the trail.<br>
                Dry Fruits: Lightweight and nutritious trail snacks.<br>
                Trail Mix and Energy Bars: Added to our collection for variety and convenience.<br>
                <br>By the time our preparations concluded, it was already 8–9 PM. Despite the late hour, we felt invigorated. The meticulous planning and camaraderie had set the tone for what promised to be an unforgettable adventure.
                            </p>
        
            <p>
                With the Royal Enfield parked and our supplies packed, we took a moment to reflect on the journey ahead. The quiet streets of Pokhara seemed to hum with the excitement that stirred within us. Tomorrow, November 7th, would mark the beginning of our trek—a venture into the breathtaking beauty of Mardi.
            </p>
            <h2> November 7th:The Journey To Deurali.</h2>
            <p>
                November 7th began with a chill in the air and an undeniable excitement as Pasang and I gathered at 3:30 AM, ready to embark on our Mardi trek. The early morning darkness brought its challenges—two hefty trekking bags, an unforgiving cold, and the logistical puzzle of fitting it all onto our trusty Royal Enfield.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pasang, ever resourceful, produced a rope he had once used to secure his bags while travelling from Mahashila. With a few quick knots and some trial and error, we lashed the bags to the bike’s side. Feeling victorious, I slung the remaining bag over my shoulder, and we hit the road toward Dhampus.
                The ride was smooth until it wasn’t. By 4:30 AM, we found ourselves in the quiet streets of Dhampus, where not a soul stirred—not surprising given the pre-winter chill. The stillness was eerie but expected. “Google Maps to the rescue,” we thought, as we relied on the digital guide to navigate our way to Deurali.
                            </p>
            <h2>Lost and Found
            </h2>
            <p>
                The route took us along narrow, off-road tracks, and just as our hope began to falter, we reached the “end” of the path shown on the map. Only, it wasn’t Deurali. Turning back, tired and slightly disheartened, we paused when we heard the faint sound of movement.
                Through the gloom, we spotted an elderly woman—the sole sign of life in the early hours. Her warm smile and guidance were a godsend, pointing us to the correct route. Suddenly, the rough off-road trails and our earlier misstep didn’t seem so bad. With renewed energy, we pushed forward.
                            </p>
           
         <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery">
          
         <h2>Breakfast with a View
        </h2>
         <p>
            Just as we approached Deurali, a hotel owner flagged us down, advising us to park our bike at his establishment as there was “no road ahead.” Looking around, we noticed several bikes already parked there, seemingly validating his claim.
            Pasang, however, was skeptical. With his experience navigating Mahashila’s rugged roads, he insisted we continue. “What’s the worst that could happen?” he quipped. And so, we pressed on, navigating what turned out to be surprisingly better roads. A mere 10 minutes later, we reached the official Deurali parking area, bustling with parked vehicles. Pasang shot me a triumphant grin. “Guess the hotel parking was just part of the business strategy,” he remarked with a laugh.
                     </p>
            <p>
                Deurali welcomed us with a crisp breeze and the promise of adventure. We secured our bike, unpacked our bags, and stepped into the village, where a golden sunrise began to illuminate the peaks. At a small local eatery, we fueled up on Gurung bread, eggs, and tarkari—a simple yet satisfying breakfast. The serenity of the morning, coupled with the breathtaking views, momentarily erased the exhaustion of our early struggles.
                However, amidst the calm, an odd encounter lingered in our minds—something only Pasang, I, and a certain local man knew. It was a fleeting moment, but one that added an intriguing layer to the morning’s events, reminding us that every journey holds its share of mysteries.
                            </p>
            <h2>A Morning Adventure with Surprises Along the Way
            </h2>
            <p>
                As we prepared to begin our trek, a minor hiccup added a layer of humor to our day. Unsure of the trailhead, I took a few steps to the left of the hotel, only to be redirected by a local man. Pasang, ever the joker, sarcastically muttered, “Bad luck from the start, huh?”
                Moments later, an older villager corrected us again, sending us back toward the actual trail. While the initial confusion was frustrating, we couldn’t help but laugh. Pasang quipped, “If getting lost was an Olympic sport, we’d have gold medals by now!”
                            </p>
            <p>
                We kicked off our trek around 6:30 am, energized and ready for the day ahead. As we began our hike toward Forest Camp, we noticed more homestays and hotels along the route. These accommodations were far more appealing than the ones at the starting point—perfect for family getaways or a cozy friends’ retreat. It was tempting to linger, but we had a long day ahead. Leaving the comfort of these spots behind, we pressed forward.
                About 30 minutes into our journey, we stumbled upon a newly constructed temple nestled within the forest. Built just 6-7 months ago, its pristine condition stood out amidst the rugged surroundings. Unfortunately, we were so mesmerized by the breathtaking views of Deurali’s unique topography that we didn’t spend much time exploring the temple. The panoramic scene before us, a mix of dense forest and towering peaks, was simply astonishing.
                            </p>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery"> 
            <h2>Two Paths, One Choice
            </h2>
            <p>
                Within 20-30 minutes of trekking, we had already gained an elevation of about 200-300 meters. After a quick water break and a brief moment to catch our breath, we pushed onward. Soon, we reached a junction offering two paths—one described as easy but long, and the other steep and shorter. The time difference between the two was about 30-45 minutes. Eager to explore both the trails, we for the day opted for the longer, wider trail.
                From the very start, the trail tested our endurance with its unrelenting incline. Fueled by a surge of morning energy, we tackled the steep section swiftly, reaching a gentler slope deep within the forest. The route was a mix of highs and lows, much like a roller coaster, which made the experience both challenging and exciting. The dense forest around us was stunning, and surprisingly, we didn’t encounter any wildlife—something I considered a stroke of good fortune.
                            </p>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery"> 
            <p>
                As we continued, I began to feel a sharp pain at the back of my foot. At first, I hoped it would ease as I adjusted to the terrain and my shoes, but the discomfort only worsened. When we finally stopped for a break, I checked my foot and realized the skin was nearly cut—likely because of the thin socks I was wearing. Thankfully, I had packed an extra pair of socks. Layering them over the first pair, I found instant relief, which carried me through the rest of the trek.
                With my foot issue resolved and our spirits still high, we resumed our journey, ready to take on the challenges of the trail.
                            </p>
            <h2>A View to Remember
            </h2>
            <p>
                After about 90 minutes, we reached a clearing in the dense jungle, where sunlight poured in like a golden spotlight. From this vantage point, we could see the village of Ghandruk far below—a breathtaking sight. Known as one of the most picturesque villages in Nepal, Ghandruk is a gateway to the Annapurna region and is famous for its close-up views of Annapurna South, Hiunchuli, and Machapuchare. The charming stone-paved trails and traditional Gurung houses make it a favorite destination for trekkers.
                Having visited Ghandruk the previous year, I remembered its stunning proximity to Annapurna I, where the mountains felt almost within arm’s reach. But seeing it now from such a height, nestled like a tiny jewel amidst the vast landscape, was humbling. This perspective not only highlighted the sheer beauty of Ghandruk but also made me realize just how much elevation we had gained on this trek.
                            </p>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery"> 
            <h2>The Jungle's Secret Village
            </h2>
            <p>
                After another hour of trekking, we arrived at a junction with a sign indicating the way to Lwang Ghalel. This small village, perched at an elevation of approximately 1,460 meters (4,790 feet), is known for its serene environment and lush tea gardens. Situated about 25 kilometres from Pokhara, Lwang Ghalel is a hidden gem offering glimpses of rural life and a chance to immerse oneself in the local culture. The village is also a hub for organic farming and is particularly famous for its tea plantations, drawing visitors who wish to explore its natural beauty and agricultural charm.
                Despite its allure, we chose to bypass the path leading to Lwang Ghalel, as it wasn’t part of our planned route. Instead, we decided to continue toward our destination. Before moving on, we considered refilling our water bottles at the route but were taken aback by the cost of Rs. 100 per liter. With a nearby stream visible, we opted to hydrate further down the trail.
                Not long after, we discovered a small stream flowing gently through the forest—a natural oasis amidst the towering trees. The water was cool and refreshing, and we took full advantage, drinking deeply and refilling our bottles. This revitalizing pause reminded us of the importance of nature's resources in the mountains and gave us the energy to press forward toward Forest Camp
                            </p>
            <h2>Arrival at Forest Camp
            </h2>
            <p>
                After about 3 hours and 15 minutes from the fork in the road, we finally reached Forest Camp. This open clearing amidst the jungle was a stark contrast to the dense canopy we had traversed. The area housed around 8–10 small hotels and restaurants, providing trekkers with much-needed rest and nourishment. The sight of these establishments, nestled in this remote setting, was a testament to the resilience and hospitality of the mountain communities.
            </p>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery"> 
            <p>
                Forest Camp marked a significant milestone in our trek. It wasn’t just a destination but a moment to reflect on the journey so far—the dense forest, the small challenges we overcame, and the awe-inspiring views that made every step worthwhile. With fresh energy and a sense of accomplishment, we prepared for the next leg of our adventure, eager to see what surprises the trail to High Camp had in store.
            </p>
            <h2>A Jungle's Challenges and Camaraderie</h2>
            <p>
                Rather than stopping at Forest Camp for a proper rest, we decided to push ahead and gain more elevation before taking a break. About 15 minutes beyond Forest Camp, exhaustion caught up with us, and we took a quick rest in the middle of the dense jungle, ensuring not to block the trail. It was around 11 a.m. when we stopped for our first lunch—a simple yet satisfying meal of instant noodles, a steaming cup of coffee each, and a few squares of dark chocolate. Despite the limited sips of water, this modest feast felt like a luxury, giving us the energy to press on.
                As we continued towards Low Camp, we encountered a couple trekking at a slower pace. They mentioned their plan to stop at Low Camp for the night. Knowing that we aimed to reach High Camp the same day, we shared our plans with them and encouraged them to consider pushing forward to High Camp as well. "Finding hotels without booking during the season is a nightmare," we warned, offering to help them find a place if they joined us. However, they seemed unsure and preferred to take their time, so we left them behind and forged ahead.
                The path from Forest Camp to Low Camp was a classic jungle trail—steep, dark, and dense in many sections. Resting spots were few and far between, and the ones we did come across were in poor condition. Despite the physical strain, the jungle's beauty and tranquility kept us motivated.
                At around 12 p.m., we finally reached Low Camp, a lively hub teeming with trekkers. It was a stark contrast to the solitude we had experienced on the trail so far. Conversations revealed that many trekkers had joined the Mardi Himal trail from Siddhing, a picturesque village located on the route connecting Lwang Ghalel to Mardi Himal. Siddhing is known for its steep paths that challenge even experienced trekkers, adding a unique thrill for those who take this less-traveled route.
                Low Camp itself, situated at an elevation of approximately 2,990 meters (9,810 feet), serves as a popular resting point. Many trekkers opt to spend their first night here or at Forest Camp before attempting the climb to High Camp the following day. Among the trekkers, we noticed two particularly energized individuals, likely from India, who had descended from High Camp to Low Camp in just one hour. Their enthusiasm was contagious, even though their plans to climb back to High Camp on the same day left us in disbelief (and perhaps a bit of sarcasm).
                            </p>
            <h2>The Final Countdown</h2>
            <p>
                After a brief 15-minute rest at Low Camp, we prepared to move on. Low Camp’s social atmosphere, filled with fellow adventurers, was refreshing, but our sights were set on Badal Danda, one of the most stunning spots along the trail. Perched at an elevation of 3,210 meters (10,531 feet), Badal Danda, or "Cloud Hill," is famous for its breathtaking views of the Annapurna and Machhapuchhre ranges. The area often lives up to its name, with clouds rolling in to create an otherworldly scene. Its wide-open spaces make it a favorite among photographers and trekkers alike, offering panoramic vistas that are second to none.
                The journey from Low Camp to Badal Danda promised more steep ascents and the jungle’s quiet charm. As we continued, the vibrant energy of Low Camp lingered, motivating us to press on and experience the magic of Badal Danda.
                            </p>
            <p>
                By 2 PM, we reached Badal Danda, completing the steep climbs and dense forest trails of Low Camp. Known for its breathtaking views of the surrounding mountain ranges, Badal Danda is a welcome break from the jungle as it sits at a higher elevation, outside the forested areas. Unfortunately, due to unfavorable weather, the views were obscured, but our spirits remained high.
                At Badal Danda, we encountered a mix of domestic and international trekkers, as well as porters and guides who joined us from Low Camp. Seeing groups returning from High Camp gave us motivation and encouragement to continue our trek. Interestingly, while we expected fellow Nepali trekkers to be more communicative and share their experiences, we found them surprisingly reserved. On the other hand, international tourists were incredibly friendly, often greeting us with a smile and a cheerful “Namaste.”
                            </p>
            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery"> 
            <h2>A Scenic Yet Strenuous Journey</h2>
            <p>
                By the time we reached Badal Danda, we were down to the last sips of water in our bottles. Despite knowing that water would cost more at higher altitudes, we were shocked to learn that a liter of water refill cost Rs. 350. While we understood the challenges of transporting supplies to such remote areas, the price seemed steep. Determined to save our money, we decided to ration our remaining water until we reached High Camp, where drinking water would be included in our hotel package. This moment underscored the value of even a single sip of water during a trek.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trail from Badal Danda to High Camp opened up beautifully, with no forests obstructing the view. The bright weather and wide paths lifted our spirits, although the increasing traffic on the trail reminded us of the trek’s growing popularity. About 40 minutes into the hike, we were lucky enough to catch fleeting glimpses of the mountain ranges, prompting me to take a few quick photos.
                However, the altitude began to take its toll on Pasang, who was trekking for the first time. His pace slowed, and he reported symptoms of altitude sickness. We decided to rest frequently to ensure his comfort and safety, even though we carried altitude sickness medicine as a precaution. While resting, I checked my phone’s compass app and confirmed that we were at an altitude of 3,300 meters—a height where altitude-related symptoms are common.
                We met a friendly female trekker during one of our breaks, who informed us that High Camp was just 40-50 minutes away. She encouraged us to consider trekking to Base Camp (4,500 meters) for its snow-covered landscapes and majestic beauty. 
                Although tempted by her suggestion, I couldn't help but glance at Pasang, who looked like he was barely holding it together. The idea of trekking all the way to Base Camp, an additional 4500m, seemed more like signing up for a survival mission than an adventure at that point. I sarcastically quipped, "Sure, Pasang, let's just sprint to Base Camp while we're at it—sounds like a breeze, doesn’t it?"
                Pasang, to my surprise, nodded with a half-smile, clearly too exhausted to grasp my sarcasm fully. We politely thanked the trekker and decided to keep our ambitions modest for the day. High Camp was already testing our endurance, so we focused on reaching it at a steady pace, taking frequent breaks whenever Pasang needed to catch his breath.
                            </p>

            <p>
                The final stretch to High Camp was incredibly challenging, with Pasang needing additional breaks along the way as the steep incline and thinning air took their toll. Despite the struggle, we pushed forward and reached High Camp around 4:30 PM. However, our hotel, The Himalayan Nest, located at an altitude of about 3,580 meters and run by the ever-hospitable Santosh Gurung, was another 5–7 minutes uphill. Positioned slightly above the main High Camp area, this quiet lodge offered stunning views of the Annapurna range. Yet, at that moment, those extra 5 minutes to reach the lodge felt like the longest hike of my life!
                Upon arrival, the hotel owner greeted us warmly. Although we had only communicated with him over the phone while booking the rooms, his friendly demeanor immediately made us feel welcome.
                The owner, with a mischievous grin, humorously commented on how rare it was for trekkers to complete the route from Deurali to High Camp in just 9-10 hours. "I mean, it's practically rarely heard of," he said, raising an eyebrow. "Most people take much longer. You must have sprinted the entire way!"
                As we stood there, he glanced down at our shoes and, with a mock-serious tone, asked us to show them off. "I bet your shoes are the real heroes here. Only special footwear could cover that kind of distance in such a short time!"
                I couldn’t help but laugh, knowing full well that the only thing special about our shoes was the amount of mud and sweat they'd collected. Still, it was nice to be recognized for our efforts—even if it was only in jest.
                Exhausted but relieved, we indulged in plenty of water—over 400-500 ml each—and checked into our rooms. Removing my heavy Gore-Tex boots felt like shedding a huge weight off my body, marking a satisfying end to a strenuous day hike.
                            </p>
            <h2>The Final Countdown</h2>
            <p>
                After a much-needed rest of about 20–30 minutes to freshen up, I decided to head to the dining hall for a hot cup of water. High Camp, perched at around 3,580 meters (11,745 feet), offered more than just breathtaking views—it came with weather as unpredictable as a coin toss. When we first arrived, the area was cloaked in thick fog, giving the entire camp a surreal, whitewashed look. But as I stepped outside my room, the clouds cleared momentarily, unveiling the majestic mountain ranges we planned to conquer the next day.
                The mountains seemed so close, almost within reach, making me wonder how overwhelming the view would be from the viewpoint or even the base camp itself. Without wasting time, I quickly captured a few photos of the ranges and the High Camp surroundings. By the time I reached the dining hall—just a few steps away—the fog had rolled back in, erasing the mountains from sight. It was a humbling reminder of the altitude’s erratic nature and the importance of timing our trek wisely to catch the best views.
                Inside the dining hall, a warm, crackling chimney greeted me. The sight of water boiling on it was oddly comforting. Resting my tired body near the heat, I sipped on several cups of hot water, savoring the warmth after a grueling day.

            <h2>The Hotel Buzz
            </h2>
            <p>
                As I sat by the chimney, more trekkers began arriving at the hotel, hoping for a place to stay. Unfortunately, the hotel had only 5–6 rooms, all fully booked. Latecomers had to return to other hotels further down, a predicament that made me silently thank the owner, Santosh Gurung, for securing our booking in advance. Santosh, a gracious host, briefly stopped by to check on us before heading to his other hotel in Deurali.
                Meanwhile, Passang had found a cozy spot to nap on a spare bed near the chimney, which I later learned doubled as emergency sleeping quarters for additional trekkers. It was a thoughtful gesture—better to offer a spot in the dining hall than leave someone without shelter, even if it meant sacrificing privacy.
                            </p>
            <p>
                As darkness fell and the cold intensified, all the trekkers gathered around the chimney in the dining hall. Conversations buzzed, particularly when they learned that Passang and I were the only ones from our hotel to trek directly from Pokhara to High Camp in a single day. This little fact earned us a bit of limelight among the group, as most trekkers had split their journey with stops at Forest Camp or Low Camp.
                Dinner was announced, and I had to wake Passang, who sprang up at my first call—probably driven by the growls of his stomach. (Let’s just say hunger is a great motivator, even more than my commanding tone!)
                The meal was simple yet hearty: dal, bhat, cauliflower, bodi (beans), saag (spanish), and a refreshing side of salad. It was our first proper meal of the day, and everyone, including us, eagerly went for second helpings. Sarcastically, we even finished portions meant for latecomers, leaving them waiting for the next batch of rice to cook. (Lesson learned: punctuality is key, even at dinner!xd!!)

            <h2>Winding Down
            </h2>
            <p>
                With full stomachs and warm hearts, we finally headed to our room. Despite the 10-hour trek, the “proper rest” we had so far amounted to only a few hours, which didn’t feel nearly enough for our tired legs. (After all, what’s 1–2 hours of rest compared to a full day of climbing?)
                Life at High Camp followed a unique rhythm. Most trekkers went to bed by 8–9 p.m. and rose as early as 4–5 a.m., a stark contrast to city routines. Since we had a late dinner thanks to our indulgent “Round 2” (yes, we blame the second helpings), we crawled into bed at 10 p.m. and managed to fall asleep by 10:20, setting an alarm for 3:30 a.m. for the next day’s adventure. (Let’s just say we realized later that this was considered “oversleeping” at High Camp!)
                As I drifted off to sleep, I reflected on the day—grateful for the heights we had climbed, the views we had seen, and the camaraderie we had shared. Tomorrow promised even greater wonders, and I couldn’t wait to see what lay ahead.
                            </p>
                            <h2>November 8, 2024: The Pre-Dawn Adventure to the Viewpoint
                            </h2>
            <p>
                The alarm buzzed at 3:30 a.m., pulling me out of a restless sleep with the promise of a spectacular sunrise. The trek from High Camp to the viewpoint was said to take about two hours, as locals and fellow trekkers had mentioned the previous night. The viewpoint, known for its breathtaking panorama of Mt. Fishtail (6,993m) and the Annapurna massif (8,091m), was the ultimate goal of this journey.
                I had overlooked a critical detail, though—Pasang had been quietly battling altitude sickness since we reached High Camp. This would be a challenge in the steep, oxygen-thin trails ahead. Nonetheless, I was determined to get moving, convinced we were the first trekkers awake. However, as I stepped outside, I realized with a mix of amusement and disappointment that most trekkers had already left for the viewpoint. “Well, looks like we’re the early birds that missed the worm!” I muttered sarcastically.
                            </p>

            <h2>The Path Less Certain
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pasang and I freshened up in record time, splashing chilled water on our faces to wake up properly—though it felt more like an icy slap. The temperature was around 2°C at High Camp, and we knew it would be even harsher at the viewpoint. We layered on every jacket and piece of clothing we had packed, looking like walking wardrobes, before stepping out into the cold darkness.
                We debated which path to take, unsure of the exact route. As luck would have it, we spotted a couple emerging from a nearby hotel. They claimed to know “half the way” to the viewpoint, so we decided to tag along. Starting at 4 a.m., we joined the procession of glowing headlamps ascending the trail, like a constellation of determined hikers.
                            </p>
            <p>
                After couple of minutes ahead, the couple admitted, sheepishly, that they were unsure of the route. “Guess ‘halfway’ means half-knowledge too,” I joked, masking my frustration. We backtracked and discussed alternative trails until Pasang suggested another path. This time, we met a few more trekkers equally uncertain about the route but pressing on regardless. The steep trail soon confirmed we were heading the right way.
                The climb was relentless—straight, steep, and seemingly endless. Yet, we pushed forward, exchanging words of motivation:
                “It’s tough now, but imagine the view at the top!”
                With each step, our excitement battled against fatigue.            </p>

            <h2>Altitude Strikes Back
            </h2>
            <p>
                Midway through, Pasang’s altitude sickness caught up with him, slowing our pace significantly. Rest spots were non-existent, so we made do with quick breaks along the narrow trail. The first orange hues of dawn peeked over the horizon, giving us a much-needed energy boost. The trails and forests we had trekked through the day before came into view, a breathtaking reminder of how far we’d come.
                As the viewpoint drew closer—just 100 meters away—I noticed Pasang struggling. Forcing him to continue seemed cruel, so I advised him to rest properly before continuing. “Missing a few moments now would feel less regretful than pushing yourself to the brink,” I told him with genuine concern.
                                            </p>
            <p>
                At exactly 5:55 a.m., I reached the viewpoint leaving Pasang down for the rest. The timing couldn’t have been better—the sunrise began unveiling the majestic peaks in all their glory. Mt. Fishtail stood tall, a sharp and distinct silhouette against the morning sky. But it was the Annapurna massif, towering at 8,091 meters, that left me awestruck. Its massive wall of snow and ice looked even more imposing up close than it did from Ghandruk which I had gone to last year.
                Caught up in the beauty of the moment, I completely forgot about Pasang. By 6:30 a.m., he was still nowhere to be seen. Anxiety began creeping in as I searched for him across the viewpoint. Without my phone, which was in the bag he carried, I felt helpless. Just as I considered running back down the trail, I spotted him sitting in a quiet corner.
                                            </p>

            <p>
                “Where were you this whole time?!” I shouted, relief and annoyance mixed in my voice. Pasang explained he had needed a longer rest but didn’t want to hold me back. Reunited, we laughed off the scare and took in the scenery together, reflecting on why we embarked on this trek in the first place. “Moments like this make every step worth it,” I told him as we captured countless photos and videos.

            <h2>Journey to Mardi Base Camp: A Snow-Covered Adventure
            </h2>
            <p>
                As the crowd thinned, we debated whether to continue to the base camp. Only a quarter of trekkers venture further, given the added difficulty. “We might never get this chance again,” Pasang pointed out. Encouraged by his resolve, I agreed. Seeing patches of snow from the viewpoint made the idea even more thrilling.
                With renewed determination, we decided to ascend further, ready to conquer new heights and make the most of our once-in-a-lifetime trek.
                                            </p>
            <p>
                After leaving the viewpoint, we embarked on our trek toward the Mardi Base Camp under the thin and clear morning sky. Just a few minutes into the trail, we stumbled upon another viewpoint, a less crowded spot that offered serenity and equally breathtaking views. We paused briefly to click a few pictures, marveling at the untouched beauty of the Himalayas, before continuing toward the base camp.
                As we progressed, the trail transformed. Gone were the familiar muddy paths; now, we faced rocky terrain blanketed with a thin layer of snow. The snow-covered stones were treacherously slippery, testing the balance of even the most seasoned trekkers. Watching a few lose their footing momentarily was nerve-wracking, but thankfully, no one suffered any injuries—something we credited to sheer luck and divine grace. This stretch of the trail was incredibly steep, perched dangerously on the edge of the hills. It struck me that a single misstep could lead to a fall so severe that retrieval would be near impossible—a sobering thought that kept us both vigilant.
                Luckily, this perilous stretch didn’t last long. Soon, we were back on the usual trails, now dusted with patches of snow. The higher we climbed, the more the landscape transformed into a winter wonderland, with the pristine white snow covering everything in sight. It was the first time either of us had trekked through snow, and the experience felt surreal. Mesmerized and energized, we pressed on.
                After reaching a comfortable spot along the edge of a hill, we decided to take a biscuit break. Sitting there, overlooking the rising sun and watching fellow trekkers move like tiny dots in the distance, was one of the most tranquil moments of the journey. Ten minutes of rest and a light snack later, we felt refreshed and ready to tackle the remaining stretch.
                The closer we got to the base camp, the more extraordinary the views became. The mountains, which had seemed so distant and elusive during our earlier trails, now stood right before us in all their majesty. Forests, hills, and other barriers were left behind; it was just us and the towering giants of the Himalayas.
                Finally, after a short but challenging push, we reached Mardi Base Camp at an elevation of 4,500 meters. The entire area was covered in snow—not too deep, but enough to leave our shoes entirely coated. It was a surreal moment. However, in true comedic fashion, we realized that neither of us knew much about the Mardi mountain itself. All along, we had assumed "Mardi Base Camp" was merely a generic name, completely oblivious to the fact that it was the base of the Mardi Himal. Our ignorance gave us a good laugh and a story to share with anyone who might ask about our trek.
                Following the now-familiar routine, we captured countless pictures and videos to commemorate the achievement. Then came the highlight of the moment—a cup of coffee brewed at 4,500 meters. Sipping that hot coffee amidst the snowy peaks felt like a celebration of our journey, a fitting reward for the trials we had overcome. The taste, while simple, felt divine, perhaps because of the altitude, the effort, or the sheer magic of the setting.
                We spent about 40 minutes at the base camp, reminiscing about each grueling step that brought us there. In that moment, we realized that while the journey had been demanding and uncertain, the destination was undeniably worth every ounce of effort.

            <h2>Descending the Ladder of Mardi
            </h2>
            <p>
                With the morning sun growing warmer, we started our descent back toward the viewpoint. The return journey followed the same route, but the melting snow and mud made the trails significantly slipperier. Every step required cautious calculation to avoid slipping, but with a slow and steady pace, we managed to navigate the tricky terrain without incident.
                As we retraced our steps, we felt a profound sense of gratitude—not just for the majestic views and safe journey, but for the lessons learned along the way. By the time we reached the viewpoint, the trail had become noticeably busier, with trekkers making their way up. Looking back at the path we had conquered, we couldn’t help but smile, proud of what we had accomplished.

            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="High Camp Scenery"> <h2>The Final Countdown</h2>
            <p>
                As we climbed down the steep ladders that had challenged us earlier, the descent felt surprisingly swift and effortless. The steepness that had tested our endurance on the way up now worked in our favor, allowing us to maintain a brisk pace. The journey down seemed to flow seamlessly—until we encountered a Swiss couple who added a fascinating twist to our trek.
                The couple, who were on a two-month vacation in Nepal, shared that they were working as finance managers back in Switzerland. What struck me deeply was their decision to leave behind their professional lives for six months to explore the world. For someone from Nepal, where societal and individual pressures often make such choices seem unattainable, their approach was both inspiring and thought-provoking.
                Their story sparked an internal dialogue within me: Could we, as Nepalese, ever embrace such freedom and prioritization of experiences in this highly competitive and demanding society? Or are we too bound by the expectations of family, community, and career to ever let go for even a few months? Their perspective felt liberating, almost like a mirror reflecting the constraints of our own upbringing. It wasn’t just a casual conversation—it was a moment of introspection that reshaped how I viewed our societal norms and priorities.
                Moving past the philosophical musings, the Swiss couple shared their recent experience on the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek. They described it as an awe-inspiring journey, marked by dense rhododendron forests, cascading waterfalls, and panoramic views of some of the most iconic Himalayan peaks, including Annapurna I, Machapuchare, and Hiunchuli. Their excitement was contagious as they recounted the serenity of the Annapurna Sanctuary and the thrill of reaching the base camp at 4,130 meters. Listening to their stories painted a vivid picture of the ABC trek, making it sound like an unforgettable adventure—a place that deserved to be next on any trekker’s bucket list.

            <h2>The Risky Shortcut: A Tale of Edges and Relief
            </h2>
            <p>
                As we continued descending, we stumbled upon a fork in the trail. One path was the familiar route we had taken earlier in the day, while the other was an unexplored so called shortcut. Pasang, ever the adventurer, suggested we take the new route. Though it piqued my curiosity, I was hesitant to recommend it to the Swiss couple, as it was an unfamiliar trail and might not suit their comfort level. Respecting their decision, we parted ways; they chose the original route, while Pasang and I ventured into the unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
                The route we chose turned out to be far riskier than we had anticipated. It hugged the ridges, with sheer drops on either side, where one misstep could have spelled disaster. The path was eerily deserted—no sign of fellow trekkers. Each step felt like a gamble, balancing between determination and caution, and we soon realized why this trail was left untouched.
                At first, we couldn’t understand why no one else had taken this route. It seemed like the perfect shortcut—quick and direct. But as we navigated the precarious edges, it became abundantly clear: this trail wasn’t avoided out of oversight but out of sheer prudence. We couldn’t help but laugh nervously at our earlier confidence and questioned our decision-making. Why did we choose this route again?
                Fortunately, luck was on our side. We managed to complete the path unscathed, albeit with pounding hearts and a new respect for the safer trails. It wasn’t the shortcut we had hoped for, but it gave us a story to tell—a memory etched with the thrill of risk and the relief of having made it through.
                Reaching the high camp, we were surprised to see the Swiss couple arriving at the same time, smiling and waving at us. They had taken the longer, safer route and still managed to match our pace. Their smiles were a mix of warmth and amusement, as if they knew something about the unpredictability of shortcuts.
                As we exchanged brief farewells and headed to our respective accommodations, a sense of satisfaction settled over me. I was deeply relieved that I hadn’t suggested the alternate trail to them. While Pasang and I had made it through without incident, it was a risky gamble I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to take.
                In the end, it wasn’t about how fast we reached our destination. The real victory was in the experience—one that reminded us to respect the mountains, cherish our safety, and laugh at the daring choices that make life’s journeys unforgettable.

            <h2>Farewell to High Camp: Packing Memories</h2>
            <p>
                By the time we stumbled back into our lodge, it was already around 10:30 a.m., and we were completely surprised to find the place eerily empty. Not a single trekker was in sight. With curiosity (and a bit of concern), I asked the hotel staff, “Hasn’t anyone arrived yet?”
                He replied casually, “Oh, they’ve all left already.”
                For a moment, I felt as if we had entered some alternate trekking dimension where everyone vanished. Then it hit me—Of course! None of them had trekked to the base camp like we had. Suddenly, their early departure didn’t seem so mysterious.
                We rested briefly in the dining hall and requested breakfast from mama (our ever-busy hotel staff). Despite being engrossed in his morning chores, he graciously served us breakfast. It was exactly the same as the one we had in Deurali the previous day: Gurung bread, eggs, and a comforting bowl of tarkari soup, paired with a steaming cup of ginger tea.
                Let me tell you, that ginger tea was the masterpiece of all teas—probably brewed with secret Himalayan magic. And as if sensing our appreciation, mama didn’t hesitate to bring us a second helping of tarkari. He might have been busy, but he still made sure we left on a high note, gastronomically speaking.
                After savoring every bite (and sip), we headed back to our room to pack up. Once our bags were zipped and slung over our shoulders, we returned to the dining hall for one last time to bid farewell. We thanked mama and waved goodbye to the cozy lodge that had been our home at the high camp.
                Oh, and yes, don’t worry—we did pay the bill. Because as much as we’d love to romanticize the trek as a life-altering spiritual journey, even spiritual journeys require you to settle your accounts.

            <h2>The Unpredictable Pace of a Trek: From High Camp to Badal Dada
            </h2>
            <p>
                As we began our return journey from High Camp, we didn’t have a fixed plan or destination in mind. Pasang suggested we simply go as far as we could for the day, without the pressure of any set goals. So, without knowing where we would end up, we started heading back. The descent wasn’t too steep, which led us to believe we would make quick progress.
                About 15 minutes into our descent, we encountered the same couple we had met earlier while heading up to Low Camp. They were the ones we had advised to push forward and join us on the way to High Camp, warning them about the challenges of finding accommodation during peak season. I was lost in my own rhythm, not really paying attention to my surroundings, but suddenly, the man recognized me and waved. It took me a moment to recall who they were, but as soon as I remembered, I waved back with a smile.
                We exchanged a few words, and I took the opportunity to recommend they visit the Base Camp for its stunning views. The man, who seemed genuinely enthusiastic, responded, "Well, I’m not alone, but we’ll definitely try if we can," he said kindly. His polite and relaxed demeanor made me appreciate how differently trekkers approach their journey. It was a brief but pleasant exchange, and after bidding them farewell, I continued on my way.
                Within 50 minutes, I reached Badal Dada, which surprised me. The descent had been faster than I expected. As I stood there, taking in the view, I couldn’t help but remember the two Indian trekkers who had descended from High Camp to Low Camp in just one hour. Their pace had been truly astonishing, and now, seeing how quickly I had descended, I finally appreciated the pace they had set.
                We took a short 5-minute break at Badal Dada, but this time, I didn’t feel the need to ask about the price of water again. Having learned my lesson earlier, I made sure to fill up my bottle back at High Camp, prepared for the journey ahead.
                This return journey was proving to be full of surprises, and with each step, I couldn’t help but reflect on how differently everyone approaches the trek—some with quick determination, and others taking their time. But in the end, we all find our way, just at our own pace.

            <h2>The Final Clearing: A Symbol of Hope and Nearing the End</h2>
            <p>
                After a short five-minute rest, we started heading downhill toward Low Camp. The jungle welcomed us back with its dense canopy, but this time, the journey felt much easier. To our surprise, we covered the route from Badal Danda to Low Camp in just 35-40 minutes, a stark contrast to our struggle during the ascent. Perhaps it was the downhill path or simply our eagerness to keep moving, but it felt like we were breezing through the trail. Low Camp, as lively as ever,some were gearing up for the journey to High Camp, while others were heading back toward Pokhara via Sidhing. Sidhing is a popular return route as it involves a steep downhill path, saving trekkers two to three hours compared to the longer Low Camp-Forest Camp-Deurali route. Unfortunately for us, Sidhing wasn't an option since our motorbike was parked in Deurali. With no time to waste, we bypassed Low Camp and dove back into the misty jungle trails.

                The route from Low Camp to Forest Camp tested our endurance. The steep downhill made our knees scream for mercy, but we pressed on, reaching Rest Camp in about 25 minutes—a pace that felt like a personal record. Despite the exhaustion setting in, we only allowed ourselves a quick 5-10 minute break.With that motivation, we pressed on and soon arrived at Forest Camp. By now, the exhaustion was beginning to take its toll. Every step seemed heavier, and our legs felt like they had aged a decade in a matter of hours. Forest Camp was tempting as a place to stop, but we knew we had already experienced the best views, and staying here wouldn't add much to our adventure. We decided to go all in and aim for Deurali, planning to rest only once we made it home.

               <p> As we trekked on, we noticed groups of trekkers just beginning their journey, despite the late hour and darkening weather. I couldn’t help but wonder about their reasoning—perhaps they had just finished work and planned their trek strategically for the weekend? It was Friday, after all. On the other hand, I found it amusing to imagine them thinking, “Why not start a jungle adventure at dusk?”After multiple breaks and relentless trekking, we reached the open clearing where Ghandruk could be seen. This spot, which had enchanted us during our ascent, now felt like a beacon of hope. While it wasn’t as magical this time, it symbolized that Deurali—and rest—was not far away and the end of our trek was near. With renewed determination, we pushed through, ignoring the protests of our aching joints.

            <h2>The Final Stretch to Deurali
            </h2>
            <p>
                At the start of our journey, we had noted two routes to Forest Camp: one tough but faster, and the other easier but longer. On our return, pressed for time, we instinctively chose the faster path, unaware of the challenges ahead. The route initially seemed manageable, but our exhausted legs quickly turned it into a grueling ordeal. Every step felt heavier, and the trail stretched endlessly before us. After about 40 minutes of relentless hiking, we finally took a much-needed break in the heart of the jungle.
                Our "luxurious" jungle feast consisted of instant noodles, dried snacks, dark chocolates, and a few sips of water—trekker essentials. The 15 minutes of rest felt like a lifetime, rejuvenating us just enough to start moving again. As we pushed forward, the peak of Deurali grew closer with each step, a small but reassuring sign that our destination wasn’t far. With the jungle thinning around us and clearer views ahead, we felt a flicker of hope. However, the ticking clock made us anxious; at 3 PM, the forest was already growing darker, and the thought of being stuck in the wilderness after sundown loomed large.
                About 25 minutes after our break, we reached the familiar fork in the trail—the one we had faced during our ascent. This time, we knew the way. Deurali was just 20-30 minutes ahead. Without stopping, we powered on, spurred by the sight of hotels perched above, their lights beginning to flicker in the distance.
                Interestingly, while heading up earlier, we hadn’t noticed many trekkers in the upper section of Deurali. But on our way down, it was a different story. Several trekkers had set up camp there, perhaps lured by the quieter atmosphere. I mused that this “upper Deurali” must be a hidden gem—a perfect spot for trekkers seeking solitude.
                The final stretch from Forest Camp to Deurali felt eternal, with each step testing our willpower. Yet, as the village lights came into view, a wave of relief washed over us. Exhausted yet proud, we stumbled into Deurali, our journey finally nearing its end. The thought of hopping on our motorbike and heading back to Pokhara was the only thing keeping us upright by that point. What a day it had been—an adventure we would carry in our hearts and legs for a long time.

            <h2>Farewell to the Trek: A Lost Stick and the Journey Back
            </h2>
            <p>
                Parched and exhausted, I made my way to the last hotel where we had breakfast the day before. Unsure if the water would cost money, as it had throughout the trek, I hesitantly asked the owner. His warm response, “Have as much as you need,” felt like an act of pure kindness amidst the commercialization of trekking trails. Grateful, I quenched my thirst and gathered the strength for the final stretch to the parking area.
                As we reached the bike station, I realized something bittersweet—the trekking stick that had accompanied me throughout the journey was missing. In the rush to start the bike, I had left it behind. The memory of it hit me hard as we neared Dhampus. The exhaustion prevented us from turning back, and I resigned to the fact that my stick was now part of the Deurali trail, hoping someone would find it and continue its journey. Though I can’t say it was “lost” (I knew exactly where it was), I let it go with a mix of regret and amusement. It was a quirky farewell to an inanimate companion of this unforgettable adventure.
                The off-road stretch to Pokhara via Dhampus felt harsher than before. What had seemed thrilling on the way up now felt punishing on our tired bodies and minds. Still, the anticipation of reaching the familiar roads of Hemja kept us moving forward. After about 40–50 minutes, we finally arrived in Hemja, where we decided to stop for a much-needed break at Café Hyale, located in Damside.
                Over steaming cups of milk tea, we relished the warmth that revived both our spirits and our energy. The tea wasn’t just a drink; it was a symbol of our return to civilization and the comforts of Pokhara. The café’s simple yet serene vibe felt like a soft landing after days of rugged trails.

            <h2>A Journey to Remember: Gratitude and Reflections
            </h2>
            <p>
                As Pasang dropped me at my home and rode off toward his, I was left in quiet contemplation of the journey we had just completed. This trek was more than just a physical challenge; it was a transformative experience. The warmth of the people we met, from the generous hotel owner offering water to the cheerful trekkers we crossed paths with, reminded me of the genuine hospitality and kindness that define these trails.
                The trek gifted me moments that words can barely capture. Seeing the peaks I once admired from Pokhara now towering before me was surreal—a dream realized. Spending time with Pasang, laughing through the struggles and sharing silent awe at the views, was a bond strengthened by the mountain's embrace.
                This journey wasn’t just about reaching High Camp or enduring the grueling return—it was a lesson in perseverance, humility, and appreciation. There was no competition to push forward, no race to be won; every step was about soaking in the beauty around us, cherishing the fleeting moments of freedom away from the chaos of everyday life. Each breathtaking view and shared laughter was a gentle reminder that life isn’t always about the finish line but the journey itself.
                As I reflect, I realize that these mountains offered a rare pause from the unending social rat race—a space where time slowed, and priorities shifted. It’s a lesson that will stay with me: to find joy in the moment and carry that peace back into the rhythm of daily life. The stick may have stayed behind, but the experience it symbolized will always guide me, reminding me of the strength, simplicity, and joy found in adventure. This trek wasn’t just a trip; it was a lifetime memory carved into the mountains and into my heart.
